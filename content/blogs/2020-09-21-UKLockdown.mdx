# Important Disclaimer

I want to start this blog with some clear statements. I am in no means making political assumptions and stating
that if other political parties were in charge things would be handled differently. Likewise, I am not saying that the decisions
that individuals have made about are wrong and were made to cause harm. Covid-19 is something new to all of us and decisions have
been made based on models, models that have been created using the data available to us at that point in time. When we look back new research will
show we should have done x, and perhaps y, but x and y weren't available to us then.

One final point. I am not saying I am better, nor an expert in emerging diseases and epidemiology, I am a computer science researcher. I for one 
voted for this government thus do not carry a bias to disagreeing with every decision made by this government. Alas, I wanted to write about my thoughts
on the current UKs handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.
