# Introduction

As this my first official blog on my new website, I thought I would give a brief introduction, so hey.
At the time of writing, I am a University College London (UCL) student. Studying for a MSc in Data Science & Machine Learning.
I have worked as a fullstack, frontend and NodeJS developer at several tech companies in Cambridge (UK), previously graduating from the University of Keele with a BSc in Computer Science with my thesis title being,

<br />
<span class='full-page-quote'>Measuring and Comparison of Monolithic and Microservice Elasticity and Scalability on Cloud Networks</span>

Upon conclusion of the project, I successfully defined one of the worlds first elasticity metric for both monolithic and microservice architectures on the cloud ubiquitous to whatever cloud
platform is used.

I have been meaning to create a personal website for the last couple of years however, have never had the time to knuckle down and create one.
Well it's 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic is in full swing, no excuses now right.

Like with most projects I wanted to dive into a new technology or framework.
I knew I wanted it to be React because of my extensive knowledge of React, the ability to work on new design patterns such as animations, style guides and hooks, but the choice of backend and deployment I wanted to experiment with.

I weighed up different frameworks, servers along with how much time I want to spend on development.
In the end opting to use the Gatsby framework.

<br />

# Gatsby

Gatsby is an open source React, GraphQL powered, static site generator. Being React was important, I can write my JavaScript to power everything on the frontend.
Gatsby does not have a backend per se, it is a static site generator meaning all the code is built and bundle and then deployed as the raw HTML, CSS & JS files.
I knew I didn't want to write backend code at the start, it is time consuming and unnecessary. I know in the future when I expand the projects on this site I will need to some APIs and so some backend infrastructure,
but thats the future. Gatsby has the ability to read external files, such as Markdown, Images, JSON and enable the static pages access to this data via GraphQL.

Gatsby is a plugin friendly architecture, meaning anyone can develop an open-source plugin for other Gatsby developers to use. These can allow for more larger, complex websites whilst keeping an iterative design approach.

Gatsby was the right for me. It has allowed me to start small, with very little infrastructure code needed and very little technical debt required to learn new languages and frameworks.
I know I will exploit the power of Gatsby plugins in the future, but only when I need them.

# Open Source

All the code this site will be pushed to my open-source repo. I will also be looking to write blog series when undertaking bigger projects on this site, and have a few ideas for some more in the future.
