This is a sample blog post to demonstrate the markdown rendering. You can write in **bold**, *italics*, or use `inline code`.

## Section Headings

Your posts can have multiple sections with clear headings. The typography is designed for comfortable long-form reading.

### Subsections work too

Organize your thoughts in a clear hierarchy.

## Lists

Here's what you can do with lists:

- First item
- Second item
- Third item with a longer description that might wrap to multiple lines on smaller screens

Or numbered lists:

1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Step three

## Code Blocks

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('World'));
```

## Quotes

> This is a blockquote. Use it for highlighting important thoughts or citing others.

## Links

You can link to [external sites](https://example.com) or internal pages.

That's the basics. Write in markdown, and the site handles the rest.
